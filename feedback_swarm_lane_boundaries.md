GitHub Copilot agent owns the already-opened and draft PRs in this swarm (e.g. PR #96 and other in-flight PRs).

**Why:** Logan assigned Copilot to manage open/draft PRs. Terminal Claude (The Abhorsen) stays in the inspect/diagnose/draft lane.

**How to apply:** Don't touch open PRs — that's Copilot's lane. Surface findings about them (risks, blockers, collision warnings) but do not merge, edit, or close them. For uncommitted local changes that need a PR, flag them for Copilot rather than opening the PR myself.
