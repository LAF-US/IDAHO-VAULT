The current version of the Tailscale client available for [download](https://tailscale.com/download/windows) requires Windows 10 or later or Windows Server 2016 or later.

This topic shows how to install Tailscale with the Windows Installer (MSI) package. If you want to use the Tailscale `.exe` installer, refer to [Install Tailscale on Windows](https://tailscale.com/docs/install/windows).

## To install

1. Download the latest `.msi` file from the [Tailscale Packages](https://pkgs.tailscale.com/stable/#windows) page. You need to choose the version for your CPU architecture. If your architecture is based on `ARM64`, use the `x86` version.
2. Run the installer. You can double select the download, or you can use the [`msiexec`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/msiexec) command:
	`msiexec /i <path_to_tailscale_msi.msi>`
	Optionally, write logging information from `msiexec` to a file. The folder used for the log file must already exist.
	`msiexec /L <path_to_log.log> /i <path_to_tailscale_msi.msi>`
3. Note the new Tailscale icon in your system tray once installation is complete. If it is not visible, select the up arrow to find it in the system tray overflow area.
4. Select the Tailscale icon to expose configuration options and status messages.
5. Under your account, select **Log in** to launch a browser window, and authenticate using [your SSO identity provider](https://tailscale.com/docs/integrations/identity).

## To uninstall

Users can [uninstall Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/docs/features/client/uninstall) through the Windows control panel.

For system administration or debugging purposes, you can also uninstall with `msiexec`. If you uninstall with `msiexec`, you must use the same `.msi` file that you used to install the client.

```markup
msiexec /x <path_to_tailscale_msi.msi>
```

You can also use the `/L` option to write logging information from `msiexec` to a file.

```markup
msiexec /L <path_to_log.log> /x <path_to_tailscale_msi.msi>
```

## Properties

If you use the `msiexec` command-line tool, you can set several MSI properties that control the user's experience with the Tailscale client. For example, this installation command hides the **Network Devices** menu item in the Tailscale client:

```markup
msiexec TS_NETWORKDEVICES="hide" /i tailscale-setup-1.22.0-amd64.msi
```

Tailscale MSI properties, if set, are stored in the `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Policies\Tailscale` registry key. The [registry value type](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/sysinfo/registry-value-types) for all Tailscale MSI properties is `REG_SZ`.

The following properties can be used with MSI.

### INSTALLDIR
