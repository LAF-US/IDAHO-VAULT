# REPORT v1.0 — Reporting Protocol

*Adopted 2026-04-22. Inspired by legislative committee reporting procedure and Mason's Manual of Legislative Procedure.*

---

## PURPOSE

REPORT is the protocol by which an agent formally presents findings, summaries, or recommendations to Logan or another agent. It includes a LEVELSET and produces a durable record.

Like a legislative committee presenting a report to the full body, REPORT synthesizes work product into structured, actionable output. It requires formal presentation, acknowledgment of receipt, and routing.

**Analogues in legislative procedure:**
- Committee Report (Findings + Recommendations)
- Testimony Summary
- Roll Call / Recording
- Dispatch to Standing Committee

---

## TRIGGER

- Task completion requiring summary
- Logan direction: "REPORT"
- Handoff to another agent
- End of session with deliverables
- Protocol: LEVELSET completed

---

## PROCESS

### Step 1: Call to Report

Agent formally announces intent to report:
- Identifies subject matter
- States time and context
- Acknowledges LEVELSET foundation

### Step 2: Reading of Findings

Structured presentation:

**A. Summary (TL;DR)**
One-paragraph overview of what was done and what it means.

**B. LEVELSET (Required)**
Six-part standard report:
1. WHO — Agent identity and authority
2. WHAT YOU KNOW — Context and scope
3. WHAT YOU'VE DONE — Work product (files, decisions, content)
4. WHAT IS UNRESOLVED — Pending items
5. WHAT YOU NEED — Requests from Logan
6. COLLISION RISKS — Potential conflicts flagged

**C. Findings**
Bullet points of discrete discoveries, decisions, or conclusions.

**D. Recommendations**
Options for Logan consideration, numbered for reference.

### Step 3: Testimony / Appendices

Optional supporting material:
- Raw data
- File paths
- Citations
- Off-record notes (if any, flagged as OTR)

### Step 4: Motion to Report

Formal statement:
> "I move that this REPORT be entered into the record."

### Step 5: Receipt Acknowledgment

Logan or receiving agent formally accepts:
> "REPORT received. [Disposition: filed / pending review / action required]"

### Step 6: Routing

Distribution:
- DECISIONS.md if actionable
- LEVELSET-CURRENT.md if state-affecting
- DOCKET if attention needed
- Relevant agent if handoff
- Archive if complete

## PREAMBLE

*(Copy from here through the dashes to invoke REPORT.)*

---

**REPORT — LOGAN + IDAHO-VAULT (AGENT)**

You have completed work requiring formal presentation. You must REPORT.

Run through the six steps: call to report, reading of findings (including LEVELSET), testimony/appendices, motion, receipt acknowledgment, routing. Use the format above.

Logan is human. You are software. The record is permanent. Report completely; flag uncertainty.

---

## MASON'S MANUAL PRINCIPLES APPLIED

1. **Findings must be distinct** — Separate observations from conclusions
2. **Recommendations require rationale** — Each numbered, explained
3. **Record is permanent** — Report becomes part of DECISIONS.md if actionable
4. **Motion establishes record** — "I move" creates the formal entry
5. **Receipt creates obligation** — Logan acknowledgment triggers routing
6. **One subject per report** — Multiple subjects = multiple reports

---

## NOTES

- REPORT includes mandatory LEVELSET as its foundation
- Significant findings warrant recommendations; routine findings may be findings-only
- REPORT can be partial (draft) and later updated
- REPORT is distinct from RISE (completion vs. presentation)
- See RISE v1.0 for formal task completion and sine die
