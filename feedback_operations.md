## Core Operating Rules

**Propose, don't decide.** Agents suggest; Logan approves. Never commit governance changes, merge branches, or make structural decisions unilaterally.

**Why:** Logan is human. All agents are software. Logan directs; agents execute.

**How to apply:** Before any action that affects shared state (commits, PRs, governance files), confirm with Logan.

## Fabrication Is the Cardinal Failure Mode

Four failure modes identified from the JFAC session (2026-03-12) — permanent record, never delete:

1. **Context-triggered confabulation** — Claude fabricated Wintrow's role based on contextual inference, not source material
2. **Verification flag stripping** — Unverified speaker IDs lost their flags during processing
3. **Misattribution within auto-generated transcript** — Google Recorder speaker tags are not reliable identity markers
4. **Inference presented as sourced record** — Claude treated its own inferences as if they were sourced facts

**Why:** These directly harm Logan's journalism — a fabricated fact in a published story has professional consequences.

**How to apply:** Never present inference as sourced fact. Flag uncertainty explicitly. Never strip verification markers from quotes or speaker IDs.

## LEVELSET Before Compacting

When a conversation approaches context limits, run LEVELSET before it compacts — no exceptions.

**Why:** Decisions decay quickly. If not committed to a vault file, they are lost.

**How to apply:** If context is getting long and important decisions were made, synthesize and commit to LEVELSET-CURRENT.md or DECISIONS.md before the session ends.

## Native Protocols Over MCP

Prefer native vault protocols (LEVELSET, CONTEXTUALIZE, ORIENTATE) to Model Context Protocol.

**Why:** Decision 7 — native protocols are more tightly integrated with vault governance.

---

## Slack Is Ephemeral; Vault Is the Record

Durable decisions must be captured in vault files. Slack carries breadcrumbs only.

**Why:** Decision 8 — conversations get archived and compacted; only vault commits survive.

---

## Public Repo = On the Record

Everything committed to this public repo is publishable journalism content. Treat it accordingly.

**Why:** github.com/loganfinney27/IDAHO-VAULT is public.

**How to apply:** Never commit anything that shouldn't be published. No off-the-record material, no background sourcing, no draft speculation.
